I am an assistant professor at  [UTC](https://www.utc.edu/). My research covers mathematical and applied statistics and machine learning.

Previously, I got my Ph.D. in Statistics from  [New Mexico State University](https://www.nmsu.edu/), where I was fortunate to be advised by Professor  [Tonghui Wang] (https://math.nmsu.edu/tenure-track-faculty/name/tonghui-tony-wang/).
