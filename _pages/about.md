I am an assistant professor at  [UTC](https://www.utc.edu/) since August 2020. My research covers mathematical and applied statistics and machine learning.

Previously, I got my Ph.D. in Statistics from  [New Mexico State University](https://www.nmsu.edu/) at [Las Cruces](https://www.las-cruces.org/), NM, where I was fortunate to be advised by Professor  [Tonghui Wang](https://math.nmsu.edu/tenure-track-faculty/name/tonghui-tony-wang/). 

This site is new and still under construction, more pages will come out soon. Please check it back if you are willing to know more about me.
